//! Environment Variables
//!
//! This class wraps the code necessary to get and set environment
//! variables in a cross-platform friendly way, taking into consideration
//! CERT's Secure Programming best practices.  The design of the
//! class interface borrows from Python, and leverages
//! operator overloading to make it easier to use.
//!
//! CERT NOTES:
//! - Don't trust environment variables
//! - The only standard C99 function is getenv()
//! - Make sure you have created a safe environment before calling exec*()or
//!   system()
//!
//! \todo ENV03-C Sanitize the environment when invoking external programs
//! \todo set IFS environment variable.
//!
//! \code
//!   Environment env;
//!   cout << env.home_path();
//!   env.set("HELLO", "WORLD");
//!   cout << env["HELLO"] << " should equal: " << env.get("HELLO") << endl;
//! \endcode
